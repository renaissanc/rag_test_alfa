                BUSINESS INTUITION
                How do business leaders make decisions – traditionally?
                1 // Business Intelligence I / The Idea Behind Business Intelligence
                Intuition:
                 Intuition is an elementary human competence, enabling us to process information
                and to initiate suitable reactions in situations with a high rate of complexity.
                 „It appears that intuition can be said to occur when an individual reaches a
                conclusion on the basis of less explicit information than is ordinarily required to
                reach that conclusion.“
                – Westcott (1968), p. 97
                [Bachmann/Kemper 2011, p. 25]
                ”Business Intuition” is the successful
                use of intuition as a management tool
                to make business decisions.
                 Intuitive decisions may trump rational
                decisions in complex situations.
                 However:
                 No explanation available.
                 Decisions remain highly subjective.
                Business Intuition may be helpful, when
                 Decisions are pressed for time
                 Decision maker has sound experience
                 Risk of misperception is low
                 Intuition is supported by additional
                information that can be processed
                 Use data, when they are available!

                Which role do data play in Digital Business?
                1 // Business Intelligence I / The Idea Behind Business Intelligence
                Data are an Asset
                 Information as an asset is a competitive differentiator for leading
                organisations as they focus on digital transformation.
                 Data and analytics become strategic priorities.
                 A company’s ability to compete in the emerging digital economy will
                require faster-paced, forward-looking decisions.
                 Leading organisations in every industry are wielding data and analytics as
                competitive weapons, operational accelerants and innovation catalysts.
                 Organisations will move away from merely using data as a resource and
                analytics as reporting and decision-making support tools.
                 Data and analytics will become the centerpiece of enterprise strategy,
                focus and investment.

                1 // Business Intelligence I / The Idea Behind Business Intelligence
                The Rationale for Becoming a Data-Driven Enterprise
                 Making data-based decisions makes instinctive and commercial sense:
                 Organisations need to ask themselves why they need data (today)?
                 For most organisations, this desire will be to better understand one’s customers and to
                improve products and services. (Ernst & Young)
                 Most companies have more than enough data to make insightful decisions, but the data
                are poorly managed and exploited.
                 Information needs to be delivered locally to ensure that insights are available to
                employees when they need it.
                [https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2016/10/28/becoming-a-data-driven-organization, October 2016]
                Data-driven organisations are
                • 23 times more likely to acquire customers;
                • 6 times more likely to retain those customers; and

                Building the Data-Driven Enterprise
                • A digital business cannot exist without data and analytics.
                • Data and their analysis bear great potential for valuable insights.
                • Businesses have to identify data sources, data quality issues, types of analysis
                and new work practices needed to use those insights.
                • Data-driven opportunities often cross organisational boundaries and require
                operating model changes to achieve the intended outcomes.
                • Data-driven ambitions change the nature of the business.
                • Data and analytics must be woven into everything.
                • Establish a data-driven culture!

                A Business Intelligence System
                is an „automatic system […] to disseminate
                information to the various sections of any
                industrial, scientific or government organization.
                This intelligence system will utilize dataprocessing machines for auto-abstracting and
                auto-encoding of documents and for creating
                interest profiles for each of the ‘action points’ in

                 Technology is merely a means for
                aggregating data and extracting

                Main Obstacles and Challenges
                Barriers to Adoption:
                Lack of data-literate, well-trained users
                and high-quality data are the top reasons
                why data analytics projects fail.

                1 // Business Intelligence I / The Idea Behind Business Intelligence
                „Mirror, mirror on the wall, which coupon is the best of all?”
                DeutschlandCard is one of the leading multi-partner bonus programmes in Germany. More than 20 million
                participants (consumers) benefit from shopping vouchers and price advantages offered for a range of industries
                on the programmes‘ multi-channel marketing platform. The partner companies are strongly heterogeneous with
                respect to their specific processes and requirements. This situation poses a challenge to the analytical applications
                which is not common in company-run customer loyalty programmes.
                Consumers participating in a multi-partner bonus programme today expect personalised offerings tailored to
                their living conditions, their current needs and wants, as well as their preferences regarding contact channels.
                The first challenge faced by the programme is thus to know or predict the participants‘ needs and wants. The
                second challenge is to map these insights 1:1 to personalised contact strategies and paths. For sure, these contact
                strategies also have to serve the partner companies‘ requirements. The key question to be answered by the
                programme is therefore: Mirror, mirror on the wall – which coupon is the best (for a certain customer) of all?

                2 // Business Intelligence I / Architectures for Business Intelligence Systems
                The Approach Taken suffers from a Number of Shortcomings
                 Data are extracted and collected by each decision making process individually.
                 Each data extract is transformed individually in order to produce what is meant to
                be the right information for the particular decision making process.
                 Figures, measures and KPIs (key performance indicators) are calculated using
                different data foundations and potentially by employing different formulas.

                2 // Business Intelligence I / Architectures for Business Intelligence Systems
                Major Disadvantages of the Individual Approach
                 Interfering with the performance of operational source systems:
                Repetitive copying and extracting of data imposes unnecessary loads on the source
                systems.
                 Retrieving inconsistent data for decision making:
                 Uncoordinated extraction of subjectively selected data by several decision makers.
                 Data extraction takes place at different points in time.
                 Data in operational systems are continuously modified by transaction processing.
                 Extracting the same data objects at different times results in different data values.
                 Individual processing of extracted data.
                 Increased efforts and higher risk of errors:
                Business-oriented alignment of extracted data has to be designed and carried out
                for every data source individually.
                 Errors may cumulate over several uncoordinated stages of processing:
                Unapparent side effects by extracting managerial data from sources that contain
                already pre-processed data of obscure lineage.

                2 // Business Intelligence I / Architectures for Business Intelligence Systems
                “Sony Masters Music Streaming Challenges”
                The music industry is experiencing a profound change in business due to music streaming. The resulting
                enormous amounts of data can no longer be analysed with conventional tools.
                Less efforts through central creation of uniform music streaming reports
                One of the most important questions for Sony is where streaming revenue comes from. To this end, the
                company continuously analyses a wealth of information. BI Manager Ryan Rauscher reports: "I would estimate
                that today we will get about three to five billion new records a week from music streaming alone. In addition,
                there is data from Shazam and YouTube. But there are also local data sources like the official market research for
                music charts in Germany, then radio airplay, classic sales figures and chart positions". In addition to the
                enormous amount of data, the rapid change in the music business also poses a challenge. The company therefore
                decided to introduce a reporting platform that makes data available to colleagues worldwide for daily decisionmaking.
                By now, around 2,000 employees worldwide regularly use this reporting infrastructure. By centralising
                reporting, the company was able to save a lot of routine work and improve analytical quality. "Previously, we
                had about 30 colleagues in Germany alone who have downloaded data every day, every week and converted
                them back into Excel reports and reformatted them", Rauscher remembers. Today, this is done centrally on the
                reporting server, and employees can devote much more time to the analysis and content level: colleagues can
                concentrate on the creative interpretation of numbers, instead of creating reports themselves and struggling with
                data.

                "We need tools that allow us to quickly try out different things, change reports, interact with the data,
                experiment with the data. "– Ryan Rauscher, BI-Manager
                Detailed analyses enable new insights for marketing
                In the past, due to the enormous amounts of data, reporting was limited to general performance indicators such
                as sales, profits, chart positions or download rates. Today, completely new questions can be included in the
                analyses.
                A large part of this positive development was due to the fact that data is now available to all colleagues,
                enabling data-based work and data-based decisions to be introduced into departments. In this way, the company
                can, e.g. also analyse the marketing influences in the streaming age. Ryan Rauscher explains: "We see that with
                many great successful songs, for example, Spotify, with their own playlists, sometimes generates over half of the
                streaming and of the revenue. These are very important insights for us, because we have to align our marketing
                accordingly.
                Agile processes enable additional flexibility and speed
                At Sony Music, the BI platform has also led to a change in the way projects are handled, giving the company
                greater responsiveness and flexibility in its day-to-day business. "We have moved away from classic project
                management with long lead times to agile work with strong prototyping," explains Ryan Rauscher. The projects
                are now virtually organised around the BI platform, which helps to execute and complete projects faster.

                BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MATURITY IN ORGANISATIONS
                2018 Survey reveals potentials and deficiencies
                Hot Spots to be addressed by organisations:
                 Hot Spot 1: Data quality
                & metadata management
                 Trustworthy data are the fuel of
                digitisation.
                 Insufficient data quality and metadata
                management inhibit deployment of new
                technology in business functions.
                 Metadata are statements describing die
                meaning, structure, lineage, and quality of
                data available in information systems.
                 Hot Spot 2: Business understanding
                 Business professionality is the motor of
                digitisation.
                 Decent business understanding is the premise
                for enabling identification, evaluation, and
                implementation of specific use cases.
                 Hot Spot 3: Culture
                 Culture is the bodywork of digitisation.
                 Corporate cultural change is vital for
                transforming an organisation into a data-driven
                enterprise.

                DATA AND INFORMATION
                What‘s the difference between data and information?
                3 // Business Intelligence I / Data Integration
                Data = Information = Knowledge…?!
                Information:
                 Piece of knowledge that is required
                to fulfill some task (function, decision, problem)
                 Relevant in a particular situation and context.
                 Effect of receiving information (e.g. message):
                reduces uncertainty in current situation.
                Data:
                 Recorded or documented statement
                of some fact, thought, or belief.
                 Purposefully collected or captured.
                 Represented systematically into a
                defined set of symbols.
                Knowledge:
                 Sum of insights governing an individual‘s
                behaviour.
                 Highly subjective: bound to an individual.
                 Unverified: an individual‘s knowledge may be
                objectively true or subjectively assumed.
                Communication
                Accumulation
                Representation
                Ex.: Pressure readings by sensor;
                customer orders recorded by ERP;
                product ratings authored by customers
                Ex.: Number of positive customer ratings
                concerning a particular product, for
                deciding about continuing this product
                Ex.: Conviction that a product should be
                discontinued, if the rate of positive
                customer ratings is continually below x%.

                 Compute functional figures relevant for management
                Rationale:
                 Guarantee consistency of metrics (in consequence of one-time computation)
                 Establish a well-coordinated set of indicators aligned with business needs
                 Improve response time for reports and queries due to pre-calculations

                Business Metrics
                Aligning data with business needs is and stays indispensible!
                 In-memory-systems do not store pre-calculated metrics physically, but rely
                on virtual data views based on defined aggregation and calculation rules.
                Distribution of operational data sources cannot be mended by technology!
                 Matter of logical data organisation and alignment with business needs!
                 Big Data platforms do not address harmonising data in functional terms.
                 Cloud-based data integration does not relieve the data integration dilemma –
                it rather aggravates it (more sources can be connected more easily).
                Why should we pre-calculate business metrics?

                An Integrated Information System

                providing unified access to a set of data sources.
                 For the user, interacting with the system should be as easy as possible.

                INFORMATION INTEGRATION
                What is Required to Achieve Information Integration?
                3 // Business Intelligence I / Data Integration
                An Integrated Information System
                 Data Sources:
                Any kind of data storage, whose data is to be included in the integrated system.
                 Identify relevant data sources and obtain access to them.
                 Recognise or develop interface for extracting the source‘s data.
                 Transparent Access:
                Transparency = invisibility.
                 A user cannot and is not required to know about internal characteristics of the integrated
                system and of the components or data sources which make up the integrated system.
                 Transparency can be related to various properties;
                e.g., transparency of sources: users do not know which source some piece of information
                is originally coming from, and they do not need to specify a particular source.
                 Metadata:
                Data describing other data.
                Examples:
                 Metadata on books: author(s), title, publisher;
                 Metadata on data sources: URL, access options, contents description;
                 Metadata on (structured) data: schema describing the structure of data records  system catalog

                Development of German Chancellors‘ Salaries up to 2019
                Information integration is quite unproblematic for a human reader:
                 Salaries in article are given in Deutsche Mark, current remunerations are shown in Euro.
                 Gerhard Schröder was German Chancellor until 2005.
                 Information is presented differently, in one case as free text, and in the other case as a table.
                 Salary figures must be recognised as written-out words as well as in form of numerals.
                 The terms „pay check“, „remuneration“ and „salary“ must be interpreted as synonymous.
                 As background information, the reader should know that the regulations concerning civil servants‘
                remunerations have not changed since long and that the salary sizes are defined at the beginning of
                each legislative period.
                Chancellors Make Good Money
                […] as Konrad Adenauer, in the early years after
                the War, was allowed a modest twenty thousand
                Mark. Ludwig Erhard, who followed after the
                Rhine-lander, earned twenty-five thousand Mark.
                […] Helmut Kohl, the chancellor of unity, could
                look forward to a pay cheque over fifty thousand
                Deutsche Mark.

                Which aspects hamper information integration in practice?
                3 // Business Intelligence I / Data Integration
                Three Dimensions of Information Integration:
                1 – Distribution
                 Data reside in disparate source systems
                 Types:
                 Physical distribution: Data reside in physically separate sources (replication).
                 Sources must be interconnectable.
                 Data are inevitably stored in disparate schemas, which cannot easily be queried
                together.
                 Logical distribution: One data element may be stored in multiple storage
                locations (redundancy).
                 Storage locations overlap in terms of the data instances (cases) they contain.
                 Redundancy must be controlled to ensure data consistency!
                Otherwise, several problems occur: Localisation – duplicates – inconcistencies
                 Causes of data distribution:
                 Historical or functional reasons:
                Data stored in departmental/functional systems
                 Deliberate design decision:
                Supports load balancing, failure safety, data loss prevention, and other measures. [Leser/Naumann 2007, pp. 51-54]

                Three Dimensions of Information Integration:
                2 – Autonomy
                 Data sources decide autonomously on their contents, structure, and access rules.
                 Legacy or departmental sources commonly evolve independently.
                 Types:
                 Design autonomy:
                 Isolated systems are typically designed those data semantics, schemas, data
                structures, data formats, and representations, that fit their particular needs best.
                 Interface autonomy:
                 Systems define standards, protocols, languages, and rules for data access.
                 Access autonomy:
                 Systems autonomously decide who is granted access to which data elements.
                 Legal autonomy:
                 Systems may deny their data to be integrated into other systems
                 Autonomy may be restricted to special exchange formats, schemas, interfaces.
                E.g., automotive companies commonly define how their suppliers must realise data access and data exchange;
                public authorities rule how banks must provide access to their data stores.

                Three Dimensions of Information Integration:
                3 – Heterogeneity
                 Two data sources that do not offer exactly the same techniques, models, and
                structures for accessing their data are called heterogeneous.
                 In practice, two data sources tend to be the more heterogeneous, the more autonomous they
                are, and if they are distributed (and administered independently).
                 Heterogeneity is the main impediment to data integration!
                 Heterogeneity may be restricted by standardisation.
                Examples: Exchange formats EBXML and RosettaNet; data model EXPRESS/STEP in the automotive industry.
                 Overview:
                 Technical Heterogeneity: implementation of access to a source‘s data;
                e.g., printed newspaper vs. online article
                 Data Model Heterogeneity: usage of data models for data storage; e.g., free text vs. table
                 Structural Heterogeneity: way of structuring and connecting information
                 Schematical Heterogeneity: selection of model elements (domains, value ranges)
                 Syntactical Heterogeneity: representation of information; e.g., written-out vs. numerals
                 Semantical Heterogeneity: meaning of terms and concepts; e.g., Deutsche Mark vs. Euro

                ETL – The Process of Extraction, Transformation, Loading
                 Transformation of data in Business Intelligence Systems cannot be restricted to the
                interface between operational data sources and integration layer.
                 Transformations will potentially also take place within and between integration layer
                and propagation layer.
                 In general, the following tasks need to be fulfilled in whatever order is appropriate:
                 Extract:
                 Identify, select, filter, and retrieve data from source systems.
                 Transform:
                 Cleanse, harmonise, consolidate, and adjust data extracted from different sources to
                comply with set rules and requirements.
                 Aggregate cleansed and harmonised data onto defined levels of granularity.
                 Augment refined data by calculating metrics and KPIs.
                 Load:
                 Import transformed data into the data structures of integrated data stores.

                Filtering: Copying relevant, correct data
                 Select relevant data and extract them from their source systems.
                 Store extracted data in an intermediate storage (staging area).
                 Cleanse stored data from syntactical or semantical defects.
                Preconditions:
                 Relevant sources identified
                 Access to sources possible
                (organisationally, legally, technically)
                 Relevant data identified (cases, attributes)
                 Frequency of extraction/updates specified
                Options for Update Frequency:
                 Batch updates:
                Extraction takes place when a defined number of data changes have occurred within source
                 Periodical updates („snapshots“):
                Extraction takes place regularly, according to set time schedules (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
                 Real-time updates:
                Extraction takes place as soon as data element has changed in the source system (triggered)

                Rules of thumb for assessing the overall quality of source data
                Example: Data table from an insurance company‘s transactional system
                 Mandatory columns?
                cust_no and premium are mandatory; all other columns may contain null values
                 Plausibility checks?
                cust_no (primary key) is subject to domain and syntax checks; all other columns may show
                inconsistencies and syntactical errors
                 Consistent column semantics?
                cust_type: originally used to distinguish private from corporate customers (0, 1);
                later further values were allowed to classify the customers‘ financial resources;
                now, private customers are rated with (0, 1), and corporate customers with (2, 3, 4)
                 Time of column integration?
                acct_mgr has been added to the table later; historical reports may show null values here
                 Plans for change?
                Next year, a redesign of the operational system for premium calculation is scheduled, which will
                impact the data structures; consequences for data extraction should be investigated

                Cleansing: Correcting syntactical and semantical defects
                 Syntactical defects: formal defects related to data representation (coding).
                Examples:
                 Formatting, special characters, particular codes
                e.g., lower case instead of upper case; characters „[r]“ for reversals, „?“ for „not known“
                 Automatic detection, automatic correction using mapping tables
                 Previously unknown/undetected spelling variants of attribute values
                 Automatic detection, manual correction by domain experts
                 Semantical defects: functional defects related to business contexts/meaning.
                Examples:
                 Missing actual values (due to neglected data transfer from particular subsidiaries)
                 Automatic detection and substitution by calculated values (e.g., plan values, previous year‘s values, etc.)
                 Value out of allowed range; total does not match sum of line items; inconsistency between related values;
                 Automatic detection possible with domain checks or special advanced techniques (plausibility checks,
                correlations, data mining); manual correction
                 Inconsistency between values; values out of allowed range; functionally incorrect values
                 Manual detection and correction, as highly contextual
                 Data defects should be detected and corrected as early as possible!

                Harmonise functional/business aspects
                 Alignment of business figures
                 All data elements and figures have to be expressed in the same units of
                measurement and in relation to the same subject areas and entities
                 Define and implement correspondence rules and transformation instructions
                Examples:
                 Convert sales figures and prices in foreign currencies (e.g., Yen, Dollars) into the relevant common
                currency (e.g., Euro)
                 Check and adjust associations of business figures with a unified set of references
                (e.g., calender year  accounting year; common sales regions)
                 Determine appropriate level of granularity
                 All data elements and figures have to be expressed on the same basic level of
                granularity, that any further calculations and analyses can draw on
                 Define basic level and aggregation rules, if figures need to be re-calculated
                Examples:
                 Summarise all business documents/receipts to daily sales figures related to product groups and
                customers, if these groups and business days have been selected as basic level or reporting.

                Aggregation: Consolidating harmonised data on different levels
                 Analytical questions mostly relate to aggregated values
                 Analyses need various consolidation levels (basic granularity not sufficient)
                 E.g.: How did sales develop with customer group A in product line B during last year?
                 Dimensions: customer, product, time; aggregated values
                 Many metrics and KPIs are possible only if pre-calculations have taken place
                 E.g., target-performance comparison for sales:
                 Actual sales figures for single products [daily]  sales per product line [month]
                 Dimensions and aggregation paths
                 Hierarchical structures

                Data Quality Issues Explained
                Types of heterogeneity (revisited):
                 Technical Heterogeneity: implementation of access to a source‘s data
                 Data Model Heterogeneity: usage of data models for data storage
                 Structural Heterogeneity: way of structuring and connecting information
                 Schematical Heterogeneity: selection of model elements (domains, value ranges)
                 Syntactical Heterogeneity: representation of information
                 Semantical Heterogeneity: meaning of terms and concepts
                 Data are accessible and retrievable by different technical means and methods
                 Accessible data are represented according to different data models
                (e.g., relational vs. XML)
                 Data within the same data model are linked differently
                (e.g., customer records are organised in two tables – customer, address – or three tables – contact,
                residence, city)
                 Data attributes (columns) in identical structures have different domains
                (e.g., gender represented as numerical integer code (0, 1) or as character string)
                 Data values in (equivalent) columns with identical schemas have different coding
                (e.g., gender information in column defined as character string comes as single character (m, f) or as
                full word (male, female))
                 Identical data values have different meanings

                Architectural Requirements
                 Independence between data sources and analytical systems
                 Analytical queries must not interfere with operational system performance
                 Persistence: Permanent availability of integrated, refined data
                 Analyses must not be restricted to availability time slots of operational systems
                 Multi-purpose data: Enable data analyses of any kind and by multiple tools
                 High efforts and complexity of constructing integrated database should pay off
                 Future analytical requirements are not foreseeable
                 Generic analytical capabilities (cf. generic query interface, SQL)
                 Support individual analytical perspectives
                 e.g., data selection and filtering; time periods; granularity; data organisation / modelling
                 Expandability
                 e.g., adding new data sources or new analytical tools should be as easy as possible
                 Automatable recurring processes
                 Loading and transforming new data cannot be managed manually (error-prone, slow)
                 Unambiguity about data structures, lineage, and processes
                 Trustability and auditability of analyses require transparency and documentation

                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage
                Staging Databases
                Temporary storage for extracted data during transformation and cleansing
                 Upon extraction from their sources, data are copied to a temporary staging area
                (sometimes also called data cleansing area or data transformation area).
                 Staging area contains data imported from several sources in various stages of
                maturity (integration and cleanliness).
                 Multi-step data transformation processes filter, cleanse, and harmonise these data
                until they fulfil defined quality criteria.
                 Readily processed data are copied to the corporate memory from the staging area.
                 After data have been loaded into the integrated database, they are deleted from the
                staging area.
                 Realisation: commonly by relational database management systems
                (e.g., MySQL, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, Oracle, etc.)

                Data Warehouse
                Integrated management database; term coined by W.H. Inmon in 1992:
                A Data Warehouse is a
                 subject-oriented,
                 integrated,
                 non-volatile,
                 and time-variant
                collection of data in support of management‘s decisions. (Inmon 1996)
                 Data Warehouses are logically centralised stores for management-relevant data,
                physically separated from operational/source systems.
                 As opposed to the simple data pool approach (cf. chapter 2, slides 10 + 11), the data
                warehouse provides integrated, harmonised data suited for all analytical tasks.
                All decision processes get the same view on the state of business (S.P.O.T.).
                [colourbox.de]
                But wait – who really conceived it?
                The true originator of the data warehouse is Barry Devlin, who in
                1988, together with Paul Murphy, developed the EBIS architecture
                for IBM. Later, Bill Inmon widely popularised Devlin‘s idea.
                „[The] EMEA Business Information System (EBIS) architecture as the
                strategic direction for informational systems [proposes] an integrated
                warehouse of company data based firmly in the relational database
                environment” [Devlin/Murphy (1988)]. [http://www.9sight.com/2018/09/thirty-years-of-dw/]

                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage
                Why is a Data Warehouse …
                 Subject-oriented?
                 Data are oriented towards management‘s information needs rather than
                business transactions
                 Decision makers should be enabled to research information on their
                main areas of interest (subjects):
                 Non-volatile?
                 Data in operational systems are continuously updated by transactions.
                 Data in the warehouse record the history of the state of business over time.
                 Time-variant?
                 Data mostly describe the state of business for time periods rather than for
                single points in time (transaction events).  original concept
                 Increasingly, warehouse data represent smaller time periods or individual
                transactions (e.g., customer-centric warehouses/CRM).

                Operational Data Store (ODS)
                Integrated transaction-oriented database for operational and tactical decisions
                An Operational Data Store is a
                 subject-oriented,
                 integrated,
                 volatile,
                 current-valued,
                 detailed-only
                collection of data in support of an organisation‘s need for up-to-the-second,
                operational, integrated, collective information. (Inmon 1999)
                 Together with data warehouses, ODSs are vital components of modern BI systems.
                 As opposed to the data warehouse, the ODS provides current, integrated, harmonised
                data that will not be stored over longer periods of time, but will be updated as new
                transactions are processed, or periodically.
                 ODSs enable new data-based services. [Baars/Kemper 2021, pp. 40ff.]

                OLAP Server
                Multi-dimensional data model providers for reporting and analytics
                Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
                 Fast: low latency; quick response times
                 Analysis: flexible, interactive interface for analytics
                 Shared: multiple users access data at the same time
                 Multidimensional: metrics need to be described by
                multiple relevant business dimensions (subject areas)
                 Information: model and contents must be suited to
                answer business questions and to derive information
                OLAP servers realise multidimensional models
                according to the “FASMI“ requirements.
                 Physical storage
                 Virtual multidimensional models

                Data Mart
                Application-specific, integrated management database
                 Data Marts are small data pools tailored to a class of applications or tasks,
                typically set up for a well-defined target group of users.
                 Considerably lower data volumes than in a data warehouse
                 Mostly, they contain predefined hierarchies, calculated aggregates, and applicationoriented business metrics ( aggregation, augmentation).
                 Ideally, their data are extracted from a core data warehouse.
                Motivation:
                 Basic Idea: Self-service BI
                Management users have direct access to the information they need
                 Autonomy: Departments want (and should only see) data that
                are relevant and helpful for their area of business and for their tasks
                 Privacy and data security: Physical restriction of data access to groups
                 Load balancing: Load on data warehouses can be reduced; better performance

                1. Independent Data Marts
                 Decentralised architecture with independent,
                application-oriented data pools
                 Stove-pipe:
                Every application area (data mart) extracts and
                transforms data separately; “data silos“ with
                restricted access from other departments
                Characteristics:
                 Reasonable only, if cross-departmental analyses are not necessary  rarely the case
                 Mostly results from historically grown structures, due to lack of BI organisation or strategy
                 Simplest and least costly architecture
                Drawbacks:
                 Multiple transformations of operational data for every application area (data mart)
                 Overlapping contents, but inconsistent data definitions, dimensions, and metrics
                 No common view on the state of business, no single point of truth!
                 No support for cross-departmental analyses

                 Decentralised architecture with conceptually
                conformed data models (dimensions/facts)
                 Every application area retrieves and transform
                data separately from the source systems
                 Alignment through inter-departmental agreements
                Characteristics:
                 Consistency and integrity of data shall be ensured by interlinked, conformed data models
                 Application-oriented data organisation and models (granularity, aggregation, augmentation)
                 Cf. Data Mart Bus Architecture according to Kimball (foundation: core DWH, poss. virtual marts)
                Drawbacks:
                 Multiple transformations of operational data for every application area (data mart)
                 Overlapping linked contents, but often still inconsistent data definitions and metrics
                 Common view on the state of business not guaranteed (often only on metadata level)
                 Cross-departmental analyses limited (potential loss of information, bad query performance)

                3. Central Core Data Warehouse
                 Monolithic approach without data marts
                 All applications are served from the core warehouse
                holding harmonised, integrated enterprise data
                 Data from several sources are extracted and
                transformed in a unified way
                Characteristics:
                 Feasible for smaller systems (few application domains, limited user count, low data volumes)
                 Common view on the state of business: single point of truth (S.P.O.T.)
                 Simplified data management and administration as compared with former approaches
                Drawbacks:
                 All information needs must be served by one single data store.
                 System performance often not satisfactory.
                 High efforts for planning, design, and implementation
                 When application domains are added or complexity grows, administration gets challenging
                quickly.

                4. Multiple Core Data Warehouses
                 One core data warehouse per business unit
                 Several logically or organisationally related
                applications are served from one core warehouse
                 Core data warehouses are planned and managed
                independently from each other
                Characteristics:
                 Helpful for companies operating several lines of business, groups of affiliated companies, or
                large-scale enterprises with a diverse range of products or services
                 Reduced complexity for very large companies
                Drawbacks:

                5. Data Warehouse with dependent Data Marts
                 Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
                One core data warehouse as integrated data store is
                fed by multiple source systems and in turn feeds
                several application-oriented data marts
                 „Corporate Information Factory“ (Inmon):
                Provides a scalable and maintainable infrastructure
                Characteristics:
                 Most popular data warehousing architecture today
                 Often developed in an iterative way, one subject area at a time
                 Reduced complexity for each application domain
                 Flexibility: Expandability (new applications) and adaptability to departmental needs
                 Customisation of user interfaces and reports for every application area/department
                Drawbacks:
                 Data redundancy and data latency (data need to pass many stages and phases of processing)
                 Single point of truth partly offset by application-oriented views as realised by data marts

                6. Virtual and Federated Data Warehouses
                 Virtually integrated data views
                 No physical transformation or storage of data
                 User queries directed to objects from integrated
                view are handled by integration tools, which
                query original sources, join, and integrate results
                Characteristics:
                Virtual architecture:
                 Integrated data view not physically materialised; exists only as virtual view on disparate data
                Federated architecture:
                 Existing analytical databases are left in place; data from these sources are accessed as needed.
                 Data sources include data warehouses, marts, operational systems, web sites, documents, etc.
                 Realised by middleware that offers distributed query and join capabilities on top of these systems.
                Drawbacks:
                 Performance and data quality issues
                 Not suited to replace data warehouses, but to supplement them

                 In practice, mixtures of components
                from several architectural styles are
                quite common.
                Origination:
                 Historically grown from partial
                solutions that need to be integrated
                 Resulting from specific design decisions
                directed at balancing support for both
                primary and secondary business processes
                 Trade-off between integrated and distributed
                solutions; often chosen as compromise
                Impediments:
                 High complexity and heterogeneity
                 Consolidation poses severe challenges on organisations (no effective migration approaches)
                 Difficult to convince legacy system users to switch to new solution

                Are there some best practices?
                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage
                Principles for Architecting BI Data Stores
                1. Every data warehouse has a core
                 Data marts should never be loaded directly from the source systems.
                 The only source system for data marts is the core data warehouse (S.P.O.T.).
                 Avoids inconsistencies; ensures globally harmonised data.
                2. Users never access the core directly
                 All queries are served by data marts.
                 The core data warehouse is intended as the central hub distributing data to applications.
                 Should direct queries against the core be required anyway, then they sould be handled by
                a virtual view build on top of the core (view as non-persistent data mart).
                 Ensures data independence of applications from unified physical data pool.
                3. One data mart exists per application area
                 A universal data mart covering all user demands leads to overly high complexity.
                 Users want to get their responses quickly.
                 Promotes implementation flexibility, manageability, and end user satisfaction.

                ARCHITECTURAL GUIDELINES
                Are there some general recommendations?
                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage
                The Core Data Warehouse: Tasks and Recommendations
                Main functions of the data warehouse in the BI architecture:
                 Integration: Harvest and integrate data from disparate sources
                 Aggregate all analytically relevant data in a logical, central data pool
                 Distribution: Distribute data to all downstream functions
                 Provide all data marts and all analytical tools with appropriate data
                 Quality Assurance: Ensure quality of management information
                 Integrated data guarantee consistency and coherence of analytical data
                In order to fulfil these tasks effectively and efficiently, these guidelines are helpful:
                1. The data warehouse stores data on the lowest level of granularity
                2. The data warehouse is build by the quality standards of database design
                 No redundancy  reduced data volume, no anomalies during updates, faster loading.
                 Data strucures are optimised for loading, aggregating, augmenting, and distributing.
                 The data are not oriented towards the requirements of particular analytical purposes.
                3. The data in the data warehouse are application-neutral
                 Data should be suited for multiple use cases (multi-purpose analyses)

                APPLICATION CASE
                Can BI make cola vending machines more profitable?
                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage
                Things Go Better with Coke’s Data Warehouse
                In the face of competitive pressures and consumer demand, how does a successful bottling company ensure that
                its vending machines are profitable? The answer for Hokuriku Coca-Cola Bottling Company (HCCBC) is a data
                warehouse and analytical software implemented by Teradata Corp.
                HCCBC built the system in response to a data warehousing system developed by its rival, Mikuni. The data
                warehouse collects not only historical data but also near-real-time data from each vending machine (viewed as a
                store) that could be transmitted via wireless connections to headquarters. The initial phase of the project was
                developed in 2001. The data warehouse approach provides detailed product information, such as time and data
                of each sale, when a product sells out, whether someone was short-changed, and whether the machine is malfunctioning. In each case, an alert is triggered, and the vending machine immediately reports it to the data centre
                over a wireless transmission system.
                In 2002, HCCBC conducted a pilot test and put all its Nagano vending machines on a wireless network to
                gather near-real-time point of sale (POS) data from each one. The results were astounding, because they
                accurately forecasted demand and identified problems quickly. Total sales immediately increased by 10 percent.
                In addition, due to the more accurate machine servicing, overtime and other costs decreased 46 percent. In
                addition, each sales person was able to service up to 42 percent more vending machines.
                The test was so successful that planning began to expand it to encompass the entire enterprise (60,000
                machines), using an active data warehouse. Eventually, the data warehousing solution now expands across
                corporate boundaries into the entire Coca-Cola Bottlers network, so that the more than 1 million vending
                machines in Japan are connected, leading to immense cost savings and higher revenue.

                APPLICATION CASE
                Can data warehousing help to save lives?
                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage
                Data Warehousing Helps MultiCare Save More Lives
                In the spring of 2012, MultiCare Health System (Tacoma, Washington), realised the results of a 12-month journey
                to reduce septicemia. MultiCare introduced a data-driven approach for care improvement based on an analysis of
                resources consumed and variations in the care outcomes. Reducing septicemia (mortality rates) was a top priority
                as a result of three hospitals performing below national mortality averages.
                In September 2010, MultiCare implemented a data warehouse and subsequent clinical and process improvement services to measure and effect care. Two major factors contributed to the success of the measures:
                Clinical data to drive improvement. The data warehouse integrated data from multiple data sources across
                the continuum of care. It became the singe point of truth requisite to see care improvement opportunities and to
                measure change. It also proved to be an important means to drive accountability for performance improvement.
                Because it proved difficult to define sepsis due to the complex comorbidity factors leading to septicemia, MultiCare refined the clinical definition of sepsis and developed an algorithm that identified a septic patient.
                System-wide critical care collaborative. The establishment and collaborative efforts of permanent, integrated
                teams consisting of clinicians, technologists, analysts, and quality personnel were essential for accelerating MultiCare’s effort to reduce septicemia mortality. Together, the collaborative addressed three key bodies of work:
                (1) Standard of care definition: Adult patients presenting with sepsis receive the same care, no matter at which
                hospital they present. (2) Early identification: MultiCare developed an early warning system dashboard that
                leveraged the cohort definition and the medical record to quickly identify patients who were trending towards a
                sudden downturn. Hospital staff constantly monitors the dashboard in order to provide preemptive interventions, if needed. (3) Efficient delivery of defined-care standards: A process was defined to ensure timely implementation of the defined standard of care. Essential caregivers are brought together in order to efficiently deliver
                time-senstitive, life-saving treatments to the patient presenting with severe sepsis.
                In just 12 months, MultiCare was able to reduce septicemia mortality rates by an average of 22 percent, leading
                to more than $1.3 million in validated cost savings during that time period. The sepsis cost reductions and quality of care improvements have raised the expectation that similar results can be realised in other areas as well.

                Data Lake Origins:
                “If you think of a data mart as a store of bottled water—cleansed and packaged and structured
                for easy consumption—the data lake is a large body of water in a more natural state.
                The contents of the data lake stream in from a source to fill the lake, and various users of the lake
                can come to examine, dive in, or take samples. “

                The Common Ground …
                 A data lake is usually thought of as a central data storage location in an organisation,
                to which data of any type, of any size can be copied at any data rate using any import
                method (initial, batch, streaming) in their original (native, raw) format.
                 e.g., sensor streams, user interaction logs, captured social media feeds, image or video
                libraries, database snapshots from ERP or CRM systems, etc.
                 The goal is to derive value from the collected data by exploring the data, training
                statistical models, and transforming the data to be used in services and applications.
                 The data lake is usually used by
                people referred to as data scientists.
                 A data scientist has a strong background in
                statistics and machine learning, is versed in
                analytical or machine learning software
                (e.g., Spark MLlib, Tensorflow, R, etc.),
                and usually can program one or more general
                purpose programming languages.

                “Internet-based Data Sources”
                 Motivation for the data lake concept: data flowing from Internet-related sources
                 The characteristics of such big data (3 Vs: volume, velocity, and variety) made it
                incompatible with existing data architectures and classical storage and analytics
                technologies of the time.
                Technology for Ingestion, Storage, Processing
                 Open source technology, such as Hadoop and associated
                systems, emerging in the mid-2000s, displayed several
                characteristics that meet these specific needs.
                 Horizontal scaling on commodity hardware offered
                voluminous storage and scalable processing at low cost.
                 Largely file-based platforms are able to store and process
                data in their raw form without the need for upfront modeling
                and design work.

                Storage Systems
                 Functional requirement: Process data of “any type, any size, and any rate”
                 Non-functional requirements: price per unit of size, reliability, security, and scalability.
                Technology for Big Data Storage
                 NoSQL Database Systems: flexible data schemas suited for varying, non-relational data structures
                 On-premise:
                 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) very popular
                 comparatively cheap; tailored to batch-processing workloads supported by MapReduce
                 Cloud platforms:
                 Cloud-based Hadoop and HDFS offerings: file-system-like API
                 Object stores: object-oriented API, better suited for RESTful communication protocols,
                e.g. Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Store, or OpenStack Swift
                 Many of these platforms rely on shared-nothing clusters built on commodity hardware that achieve
                reliability, durability, and scalability by replicating and striping chunks of data across the cluster.
                 Complexity of on-premise installation, configuration, and administration:

                 Functional requirement:
                Move data from external sources into the lake “using any import method (initial, batch, streaming)”
                Technology for Big Data Ingestion
                 Operational modes:
                 Pull: extract data from source systems
                 Push: receive data from external sources and data streams
                 Example: Apache Sqoop can connect to external database systems to bulk-load (pull) relational data to HDFS.
                 Ingesting streaming data requires tools that can buffer the streams and convert the buffered data
                to batches before writing to some store like HDFS.
                 Sometimes batching also involves aggregation, conversion, or cleansing directly on the stream.
                 Solutions make use of scalable message queues (e.g., Apache Kafka) and data stream engines (e.g., Samza, Flume,
                or Spark streaming) to condense and store streaming data or extracts thereof on the lake.

                Data Profiling and Integration
                 Functional requirement: Transform and integrate data stored in “their original format” in the lake
                 Data integration problem (often aggravated by inconsistent and incomplete data).
                 Data understanding problem (structure, quality, schema) in order to process them correctly.
                 Information extraction: Finally, relevant information can be extracted from raw data and
                transformed into a format that allows correlation with other data.
                Solution for Big Data Profiling and Integration
                “Schema-on-read” approach:
                 The data schema is defined only when the data will finally be used for a specific analysis.
                 Different data schemas may be defined for the same data set, depending on the analytical goals,
                context, and specific data attributes that are of interest for answering an analytical question.

                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage / Data Lake 35
                From a Purely Pragmatic Approach …
                 This programmatic and procedural approach to data processing (as opposed to the declarative
                approach known from relational database technology, long favored by data management
                professionals) was attractive to the early adopters of the technology, because of their strong
                engineering backgrounds.
                 Originally, the Data Lake approach was not meant to be used as foundation for operational, daily
                decision making. It was meant as a playground for data scientists to explore new opportunities.
                [Devlin 2018, p. 19]
                An Early Definition:
                “A data lake is a collection of storage instances of various data assets additional to the originating data sources.
                These assets are stored in a near-exact, or even exact, copy of the source format. “
                …
                “The purpose of a data lake is to present an unrefined view of data to only the most highly skilled analysts,
                to help them explore their data refinement and analysis techniques independent of any of the system-of-record
                compromises that may exist in a traditional analytic data store (such as a data mart or data warehouse). “

                 Data object types (entities)
                 Relationships
                 Attributes (properties)
                Purpose of Modelling in General
                 Document situations or facts
                 Support communications of facts

                to identify an entity (row) and

                With keys, we can model
                references (relationships)
                between relations.
                In these referenced relations,
                the corresponding attribute is
                declared as foreign key.

                Model-Specific Integrity Constraints
                Entity Integrity:
                 For key attributes, NULL values are not
                allowed!
                 NULL is a special token signalling the absence
                of an attribute value (NULL ≠ 0!)
                 Entities represent objects, events, or facts.
                 The relational model represents entities
                exclusively by their attribute values.
                 Every key value uniquely identifies one entity.
                Referential Integrity:
                 For every foreign key value, there must
                exist a corresponding key value in the
                referenced relation!
                 An attribute FK  A is a foreign key in R(A),
                if FK is key in R‘ (R‘≠ R), and for every FK value
                in r:R, there exists a corresponding key value
                in r‘:R‘.

                Normal Forms
                 The design of „good“ relational schemas is supported by a set of design criteria,
                which aim at avoiding redundancies and anomalies in the database.
                 These criteria are called normal forms and are based on the theory of functional
                dependencies and keys.
                Relation type R(A) with attribute set A = A1
                , A2
                , …, An
             and attribute subsets X and Y, (X, Y  A), X ≠ 
                 Functional dependency X  Y:
                FOR EACH pair of tuples within any relation r of type R (r:R), the following condition holds:
                IF values of X are identical, THEN values of Y are identical as well.
                 Full functional dependency X• Y:
                X is minimal, i.e., there is no Z  X with Z  Y.
                 Candidate key X:
                X is a (candidate) key for R, if X • A
                 Full functional dependency means, that there are no partial
                dependencies between key attributes and non-key attributes.

                Normal Forms (2)
                 The theory of normal forms is rather complex.
                 For our purposes, we can abstract from all those annoying details.
                Simply put, we can define the following normal forms:
                 1st Normal Form (1NF):
                A relation type is in 1NF,
                IF the domains of all attributes are elementary (atomic).
                 2nd Normal Form (2NF):
                A relation type is in 2NF, IF it is in 1NF, AND
                IF all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on each candidate key.
                 Keys must be minimal; no partial functional dependencies with subsets of keys!
                 3rd Normal Form (3NF):
                A relation type is in 3NF, IF it is in 2NF, AND
                IF no transitive dependencies exist among non-key attributes.

                A more detailed summary:
                 A table is in 1NF when all attributes are atomic, when all the key attributes are defined,
                and when all remaining (non-key) attributes are dependent on the primary key.
                 A table in 1NF can still contain both partial and transitive dependencies.
                 A partial dependency is one in which an attribute is functionally dependent on only a part of a multi-attribute
                primary key.
                 Naturally, a table with a single-attribute primary key cannot exhibit partial dependencies.
                 A table is in 2NF when it is in 1NF and contains no partial dependencies.
                 A table in 2NF may still contain transitive dependencies.
                 A transitive dependency is one in which one attribute is functionally dependent on another non-key attribute.
                 A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and contains no transitive dependencies.

                 To introduce elementary concepts of the multidimensional data model, the SDWM notation will be
                used on the upcoming slides.

                Operations on Multidimensional Data Structures
                 For analytical data processing, navigating in the multidimensional data space is vital:
                 Access to quantitative data, starting from given qualitative data
                 Dynamic, flexible variation of the perspective taken on the data
                 Navigation along dimensions and dimensional hierarchies
                The following operations are defined on multidimensional data structures:
                 Drill-down / Roll-up: Variations of aggregation level
                 Slice / Dice: Selections within the hypercube
                 Rotate: Variations of perspective
                 Nest: Establishing cross-tabulations
                 OLAP Join: Calculating derived metrics
                On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)
                OLAP (on-line analytical processing) is the name given to the dynamic enterprise analysis required to create,
                manipulate, animate and synthesize information from (...) data analysis models (...). This includes the ability to
                discern new or anticipated relationships between variables, the ability to identify the parameters necessary to
                handle large amounts of data, to create an unlimited number of dimensions (consolidation paths) and to specify
                cross-dimensional conditions and expressions

                 No physical storage of multidimensional structures
                 Multidimensional data structures are generated on-the-fly
                from relational database systems at access time by special

                Optimising ROLAP Performance
                 In ROLAP systems, queries against multidimensional data space are translated into
                SQL statements and are answered by a relational database management system.
                 Special requirements towards the structure of the database schema and the
                access paths/indexes (logical and physical layer of the database model).
                 Structural options for increasing query performance:
                 Special database schemas  star schema, snowflake schema
                 Pre-aggeregation tables (tables with pre-calculated aggregated metrics)
                 Special indexes
                 Technological options for increasing query performance:
                 High-performance server hardware

                Star Schema
                 Star-shaped table structure
                 Centre: Facts table (metrics)
                 Vertices: Dimensional tables
                 Every dimension is stored in one dimensional table, together with all of its
                aggregation levels and attributes
                 Redundant data storage  denormalised schema
                 Anomalies are ignored (read access only)
                 The dimensional tables‘ primary keys (always on the lowest level) are propagated
                into the facts table, where they collectively make up the facts table‘s primary key
                 Characteristics of star schema:
                 Simplicity and clarity
                 Low query complexity, few joins
                 Increased storage consumption due to redundant data
                 Individual aggregation levels are not directly recognisable

                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage / Data Modelling
                General Directions for Modelling Hypercubes on the Logical Level
                 Before starting with constructing relational schemas, you should develop a thorough
                understanding of the multidimensional context:
                 Semantical/conceptual modelling (also informally without modelling approach)
                 Relationships between metrics, dimensions, and aggregation levels
                 Use a unified naming convention for attributes – this will facilitate your efforts and
                foster understanding of the columns‘ semantics:
                 Table names according to the table‘s roles
                (e.g., prefixes “F“, “D“, “H“ for facts/dimensional/hierachchical tables, resp. (cf. examples)
                 Identifying attributes (e.g., suffix “ID“: Customer_ID, Article_ID, …)
                 Descriptive attributes (e.g., suffix “DESC“: Customer_DESC, Article_DESC, …)

                 Integrity rules are particularly important for aggregation paths

                 Disjoint: aggregation without multiple counting requires disjoint assignments of
                 Facts/objects to dimensional elements
                 Dimensional elements on multiple aggregation levels
                 Complete: meaningful aggregations require exhaustive set of dimensional
                elements on every aggregation level (e.g., cities  countries)
                 Type compatible:
                 Flow figures:
                aggregation usually unproblematic
                 Stock figures:
                aggregation possible,

                4 // Business Intelligence I / Data Storage / Data Modelling
                Overview over Database Models
                Historical data models:
                 Hierarchical model: dependencies between entities as hierarchical structures (1:n)
                 Network model: navigation paths through relationships between entities (m:n)
                Nested models:
                 NF2
                (non first normal form) model: e.g., product data, bills of materials, CAD
                 Object model: arbitrarily complex data structures (cf. programming languages)
                 XML model: similar to object model, but document-oriented (data exchange, serialisation)
                Special-purpose models:
                 Graph model: native representation of graph structures
                 Geographical models: representation of spatial areas and location points
                Hybrid and „schema-free“ models:
                 Key/value model: all data are represented as pairs of keys and (complex) values
                 Document model: cf. object/XML models, but more flexible
                 Wide column/column family models: nested tables, versioning of values (e.g., search engines)

                 Metaphor: Dashboard in a Car Cockpit
                 Displays at a glance the information directly
                relevant for steering the car
                 Represents the current state of the car / ride
                 Notifies driver in exceptional situations that
                require attention or intervention
                 Definition:
                A dashboard is a visual display
                of the most important information
                needed to achieve one or more objectives,
                consolidated and arranged on a single
                screen so the information can be
                monitored at a glance.

                Overall Structure: Multiple Dashboards
                 Organise content elements within a reporting system by user roles or tasks.
                 Alternative structuring options: functional areas, organisational units, objects
                 e.g., product manager, purchasing agent | customer service | machine monitoring
                Internal Structure: Arranging Elements within a Dashboard
                 Each dashboard page should answer exactly one analytical question!
                 e.g., enable/facilitate comparisons | identify developments, correlations, etc.
                 Multiple, logically related analytical questions are answered on multiple interlinked
                dashboard pages.
                 Storytelling:
                 Every dashboard should „tell a story“, or „let the data speak“.
                 Storytelling is a concept in reporting for structuring management information
                in such a way that the users will not be left with open questions

                Dashboard Design should strictly Focus on the User
                 Information requirements and usage context determine the dashboard contents
                 Typical question chains determine the dashboard structure
                 Graphical Design:
                 Consider limitations and potentials of human perception!
                 Define information design as corporate style guide.
                 Orientation by literature on principles and guidelines:

                Provide strategically relevant, actionable management information
                 The starting point for a reporting conception are always the overall goals and
                strategies of the company.
                 Reporting should be able to provide supporting information for the assessment of
                the current situation, for the diagnosis of causes, for the determination of objectives
                as well as for the design of measures of action.
                 Identify those factors of a company's business model that are relevant for
                managing and controlling the company and that drive value creation
                 Strategical relevance:
                Which factors influence our company’s success?
                 Actionability:
                Which factors can we actively control/influence in the respective functional area?

                Standard References for Time Comparison
                 For correctly assessing the current system state, several time-related values or
                aggregations are common:
                 Values for previous periods: direct and last year
                 Latest Period: this is referred to as “now” – data are often not completely available yet
                 Reporting Period: latest period with complete data, usually the period of interest
                 Previous Period (PP): the period directly preceding “now” (day, week, month, etc.)
                 Previous Year Period (PY): the same period as “now”, as of last year ( smoothing seasonal variations)
                 Aggregations for current year
                – per calendar or months
                 Year to Date (YTD): aggregates the metric for
                the current calendar year until now
                 Moving Annual Total (MAT): aggregates the metric
                for the last 12 months from now backwards
                 PP, PY, YTD, MAT can be presented to the user as elements
                of special ‘version dimensions’ (e.g., comparison type).
                They will be translated into concrete time periods according to
                the selected reporting period.
                 PP and PY can be provided as reference for generic growth/change metrics (e.g., absolute or relative change).

                FOUNDATIONAL APPROACHES TO DATA ANALYSIS
                Which role do hypotheses or theories play?
                Hypotheses can act as triggers or as results of data analyses
                “Exploratory data analysis is about looking at the
                data to see what it seems to say.”
                – John Wilder Tukey
                Analytical Goals:
                 Empirical verification
                of an assumption, a

                theory to new cases

                DATA MINING & CO.
                What is the idea and the overall goal of data mining?
                 Automation of exploratory data analysis
                 Ability to evaluate very large, high-dimensional data spaces (many variables)
                 Use of extremely complex calculation methods and algorithms
                 Data mining is the central step of algorithm application within the KDD process,
                which includes further steps (data preparation, result preparation).
                 Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is a process for discovering valid, new,
                potentially useful and understandable patterns in data
                 Validity  Verified patterns (knowledge s. str.)
                 Novelty, understandability, usefulness  Information
                 Machine Learning (ML) is a sub-discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
                represents a large portion of the algorithms used for data mining.
                 Data Science is an empirical discipline that uses various methods (mainly from the
                fields of machine learning and statistics) to generate new knowledge from data with
                the help of algorithms.

                RESULT TYPES IN DATA MINING
                Which interesting statements can we get from data mining?
                 Variations or deviations: Deviation Detection
                Detect and describe (explain) significant variations of key figures (or other observations)
                over time or their deviation from expected, planned, or desired values.
                Examples:
                 Detect unusual behaviour within time series of sensor values;
                 Automatic navigation in controlling data, where observations on aggregated levels will be traced down to
                lower levels in order to derive explanations for these phenomena.
                 Associations, dependencies, and sequences: Correlation Detection
                Detect objects that regularly occur together in events (transactions), that show causal
                correlations, or that tend to occur in regular sequences.
                Examples:
                 Associations in telecommunication; connectedness in social media networks;
                cross-selling relationships of articles in shopping carts (“customers who bought this article…“)
                 Error detection in technical infrastructures; fraud detection in financial transactions, where all positive
                events (error, fraud) are characterised by special causal events (triggers) or preceding indicators
                 Click-stream analysis in web platforms, where typical navigation paths on web sites
                are analysed to optimise web design

                RESULT TYPES IN DATA MINING
                Which interesting statements can we get from data mining?
                 Similarities of objects: Segmentation (Cluster Analysis)
                Detect classes of objects grouping elements which are very similar to each other (intra-group
                homogeneity), but show significant distinctions among groups (inter-group heterogeneity).
                Examples:
                 Detect groups of similar customers that can be treated differently by marketing.
                 Identify suspicious constellations of sensor values in production facilities
                which may indicate upcoming technical exceptions or error situations.
                 Classification and prediction models: Model Training and Fitting
                Use data on historical or current system/object behaviour to learn classification or regression
                rules in order to predict (or estimate) future system/object behaviour.
                Examples:
                 Determine (predict) whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not,
                based on the details of the current transaction and on the history of the card holder’s
                former transactions.
                 Calculate the probability that a customer will close their contract with a telecommunications company
                and switch to another provider.
                 Predict the revenue of a new customer in the next three years, based on
                the customer details and the history of other (similar) customers in the database.

                PATTERNS AND MODELS
                What is the difference between a pattern and a model?
                 Summarisations, associations, regularities, etc. are often called patterns or models.
                 Pattern:
                 Statement on a subset of the data, which is simpler than the mere
                enumeration of all elements in that subset
                 A pattern is a local structure, supported only by some cases or by a particular
                region in the data space
                 Model:
                 Structure at a higher level, summarising correlations among many cases
                 A model aims at comprehensively approximating the behaviour of the
                whole system under study
                 A pattern can occur as an element or as an instantiation of a model:
                E.g., f(x) = αx
                2 + βx is a model, whereas f(x) = 3x2 + x represents a pattern.
                Expressing Regularities
                „Given a set of facts (data) F, a language L, and some measure of certainty C, we define
                a pattern as a statement S in L that describes relationships among a subset FS of F with a
                certainty c, such that S is simpler (in some sense) than the enumeration of all facts in FS
                .”

                Segmentation (Clustering) in Retail
                5 // Business Intelligence I / Data Analysis
                 Clustering: The basic idea
                 Group similar objects based on their characteristics into
                classes (clusters, segments).
                 General optimisation goal: maximise both intra-group
                homogeneity and inter-group heterogeneity
                 Clusters are not pre-defined, but determined by algorithm
                 Interpretation of cluster analyses:
                 Clusterings are not self-descriptive
                 Manual interpretation or further analysis required
                 Large clusters often verify expectations or hypotheses,
                whereas small clusters are often the most interesting ones.
                Hierarchical techniques start with either one cluster per object,
                that will be aggregated gradually (agglomerative approach), or
                with one cluster holding all objects, which will be divided into
                multiple segments during the process (divisive approach).
                Partitioning techniques start with a given (often random)
                segmentation, which will be incrementally modified until
                optimum is reached. Ex.: k-Means, DBSCAN, neural networks

                How does Netflix recommend content to their users?
                5 // Business Intelligence I / Data Analysis
                Betting on Big Data to Refine Recommendations
                Viewer interests and behaviour tend to change rapidly, and it might be quite difficult to predict what content
                they will acquire and enjoy next. For example, Netflix found out that users quickly lose interest after 60-90
                seconds of choosing, having reviewed maybe 10 or 20 titles on no more than two screens.
                Therefore, tailor-made video recommendations are to make sure that every user will find something compelling
                to view in this short time frame, and that they will understand why it might be interesting. The company uses
                lots of data sources to feed the machine learning algorithms of its recommendation engine. For instance, they
                have billions of member ratings and receive several million daily stream plays — with info about duration, time
                of day, and device type. The company also analyses social data, movie metadata (actors, director, genre, parental
                rating, reviews), films’ popularity, queue items, demographics, location, language, and more.
                To smartly manage this great availability of data, Netflix implements all sorts of ML approaches, including
                clustering algorithms, linear and logistic regression, Markov chains, and association rules.
                In turn, this ML-based model allows the media provider to automatically deliver personalised offerings in
                terms of content, payment methods, and subscription types. According to Netflix, the results are impressive, with
                more than 75% of streaming hours coming directly from its recommendation engine.
                Every row on the homepage is typically provided
                by one particular algorithm, generating specific offers:

                The corporation also puts viewing data to good use by personalising movies’ artworks. What does that mean?
                Netflix’s ML algorithms analyse a user’s preferences, namely favorite genres and actors, to generate the most
                relevant imagery for a film.
                For instance, if your viewing history says you like comedies, the artwork of the recommended content will
                likely include a comedian (fig. 1a). And if you’re a romantic movie lover, be sure to mostly get recommendations
                featuring romantic scenes (fig. 1b). Netflix will also spot your cast preferences to feature the artwork with a
                beloved actor/actress (fig. 2).
                Fig. 1
                Fig. 2
                Netflix says the steps they took in personalising the artworks led to a meaningful improvement in how viewers
                find new content. The video provider also plans to expand this approach and personalise other types of artworks
                they use, such as synopses, metadata, and trailers. [Amatriain/Basilico (2012); Chandrashekar et al. (2017)]

                The recommender system is vital for business performance, as it helps Netflix win moments of truth – those
                situations when customers decide whether or not they want to buy or use the services of a company. When a user
                starts a session and the recommender engine helps that user find something engaging within a few seconds, this
                ensures that Netflix’s services are used, and that the user does not switch to alternative options.




                Fig. 3
                Personalisation allows companies to significantly increase success when offering recommendations. One metric
                that gets at this is the take-rate—the fraction of recommendations offered resulting in a play. The two lines in the
                plot in fig. 3 show the take-rate, one as a function of a video’s popularity, and the other as a function of a video’s
                PVR rank. The lift in take-rate that comes from recommendations is substantial. Finally, recommendations lead to
                increases in overall engagement with the product (e.g., streaming hours) and fewer subscription cancellations.
                Netflix’ monthly churn rate is in the low single-digits, and much of that is due to payment failure, rather than
                an explicit subscriber choice to cancel service. Over years, the company has reduced churn by several percentage
                points. Reduction of churn both increases the lifetime value of an existing subscriber, and reduces the number of
                new subscribers they need to acquire to replace cancelled subscribers. Netflix estimates that their personalised
                recommendations saves them more than $1B per year.

                RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
                Which basic approaches exist for recommender engines?
                5 // Business Intelligence I / Data Analysis
                Recommendations based on Items or based on Users
                 Content-based Filtering:
                 Analysing properties of products/content items
                 Identifying products/items similar to the one
                currently in question
                 Recommending the most relevant similar items
                 Collaborative Filtering:
                 Analysing behaviour of users
                 Identifying users who also liked/bought/viewed …
                the product/items currently in question
                 Recommending items that other users liked

                RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
                When should we employ which recommender function?
                5 // Business Intelligence I / Data Analysis
                What can Recommender Systems achieve?
                 Search Costs: Helping customers find what they like
                 Consumers can only benefit from extensive assortments if they are supported in their product selection
                by search and recommendation systems.
                 Objective: Reduce search costs for the customer/user
                 Examples for search costs (according to studies and experiments):
                Online shopping: USD 6.45 per product purchase | online auction: EUR 3.54-6.08 per bid
                 Expansions of the product range can lead to both extra consumption and to substitution effects.
                 Niche products are thus gaining strongly in importance
                 Example amazon.com: Books with sales rank &gt; 250,000 account for 29.3% of sales
                 General effects of reduced search costs to be observed:
                 Search functions (active search by customer/user)  tendency towards additional consumption
                 Hit lists  tendency towards additional consumption
                 Recommender systems  substitution (shift to/from niches)
                 Substitution makes sense from the supplier's point of view, if consumers choose more profitable
                products/services (e.g. higher contribution margin)
                [Hinz, O.; Eckert, J.: Der Einfluss von Such- und Empfehlungssystemen auf den Absatz im E-Commerce, in: Wirtschaftsinformatik 52 (2010) 2, pp. 65-77. DOI:

                When should we employ which recommender function?
                5 // Business Intelligence I / Data Analysis
                What can Recommender Systems achieve?
                 Effects of search and recommendation functions
                Reducing search costs through search systems: effective for all products
                 Niches benefit more from additional consumption; higher sales volume.
                 Demand redirected away from blockbusters towards niches; sales volume may even decline.
                 Search systems make sense on saturated markets if niche products are more profitable than blockbusters;
                on unsaturated markets, implementing search systems is generally helpful (additional consumption).
                Reducing search costs through recommender systems: effective mainly for niche products
                 Additional sales generated in the niches; higher sales volume
                 Consumers substitute blockbuster with niche products; sales stagnate
                 Recommender systems on saturated markets make sense only if niche products are more profitable than
                blockbusters; on unsaturated markets, additional consumption may occur together with substitution
                Reducing search costs through hit lists and charts: effective mainly for blockbusters
                 Additional purchases of blockbusters; higher sales
                 Consumers substitute niche products with blockbusters; sales stagnate
                 Hit lists on saturated markets make sense only if blockbusters are more profitable than niche products;
                on unsaturated markets, additional consumption usually occurs together with substitution

                RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
                When should we employ which recommender function?
                5 // Business Intelligence I / Data Analysis
                What can Recommender Systems achieve?
                 General Findings:
                Hit lists recommend high-selling products (e.g. music charts)
                 Similar effects: (1) non-personalised advertising, (2) customer recommendations (word of mouth)
                Simulation study:
                 Search and recommender systems reduce the concentration of sales on blockbusters,
                 while hit lists increase it.
                Summary:
                 Search and recommender systems support sales of niche products
                 Hit lists support sales of blockbusters
                 Consumers benefit from both types of systems
                (better coverage of preferences through additional or other products offered/recommended)
                 Suppliers only benefit if they manage to redirect sales to more profitable products.
                 From the supplier's point of view, such systems are always considered helpful on unsaturated markets
                (increased consumption).
                 Entertainment and leisure markets are typically rated as unsaturated.
