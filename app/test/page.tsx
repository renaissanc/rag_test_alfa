        BUSINESS INTUITION
        How do business leaders make decisions – traditionally?
        1 // Business Intelligence I / The Idea Behind Business Intelligence
        Intuition:
         Intuition is an elementary human competence, enabling us to process information
        and to initiate suitable reactions in situations with a high rate of complexity.
         „It appears that intuition can be said to occur when an individual reaches a
        conclusion on the basis of less explicit information than is ordinarily required to
        reach that conclusion.“
        – Westcott (1968), p. 97
        [Bachmann/Kemper 2011, p. 25]
        ”Business Intuition” is the successful
        use of intuition as a management tool
        to make business decisions.
         Intuitive decisions may trump rational
        decisions in complex situations.
         However:
         No explanation available.
         Decisions remain highly subjective.
        Business Intuition may be helpful, when
         Decisions are pressed for time
         Decision maker has sound experience
         Risk of misperception is low
         Intuition is supported by additional
        information that can be processed
         Use data, when they are available!

        DATA-DRIVEN ENTERPRISE
        Which role do data play in Digital Business?
        1 // Business Intelligence I / The Idea Behind Business Intelligence
        Data are an Asset
         Information as an asset is a competitive differentiator for leading
        organisations as they focus on digital transformation.
         Data and analytics become strategic priorities.
         A company’s ability to compete in the emerging digital economy will
        require faster-paced, forward-looking decisions.
         Leading organisations in every industry are wielding data and analytics as
        competitive weapons, operational accelerants and innovation catalysts.
         Organisations will move away from merely using data as a resource and
        analytics as reporting and decision-making support tools.
         Data and analytics will become the centerpiece of enterprise strategy,
        focus and investment.

        DATA-DRIVEN ENTERPRISE
        Does the strategic role of data make a difference?
        1 // Business Intelligence I / The Idea Behind Business Intelligence
        The Rationale for Becoming a Data-Driven Enterprise
         Making data-based decisions makes instinctive and commercial sense:
         Organisations need to ask themselves why they need data (today)?
         For most organisations, this desire will be to better understand one’s customers and to
        improve products and services. (Ernst & Young)
         Most companies have more than enough data to make insightful decisions, but the data
        are poorly managed and exploited.
         Information needs to be delivered locally to ensure that insights are available to
        employees when they need it.
        [https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2016/10/28/becoming-a-data-driven-organization, October 2016]
        Data-driven organisations are
        • 23 times more likely to acquire customers;
        • 6 times more likely to retain those customers; and
        • 19 times more likely to be profitable as a result.

        Building the Data-Driven Enterprise
        • A digital business cannot exist without data and analytics.
        • Data and their analysis bear great potential for valuable insights.
        • Businesses have to identify data sources, data quality issues, types of analysis
        and new work practices needed to use those insights.
        • Data-driven opportunities often cross organisational boundaries and require
        operating model changes to achieve the intended outcomes.
        • Data-driven ambitions change the nature of the business.
        • Data and analytics must be woven into everything.
        • Establish a data-driven culture!
        • The entire organisation needs to become data-literate.
        • Being data-driven is a team sport and requires collaboration, as well as effective
        and ongoing training programs.
